      <h2>Snap! Quiz</h2>
    <p>A project done in AP Computer Science is to make a basic quiz using the coding language "Snap!". My partner decided to make it a math quiz. We did this by following a guide on the website The Beauty and Joy of Computing. One challenging part of it was what to define the “question from quiz item” and “answer from quiz item” blocks as. I learned about how to use variables from this experience.</p>

      <h2>Python CMU</h2>
    <p>A project I did on my own in AP Computer Science was to use python. The goal of this was to find out how to use python to make graphics. I did this by following the guide made by CMU CS Academy. A difficulty I encountered was remembering the exact format of codes. I learned how to use python from this experience.

      <h2>Victor</h2>
    <p>A project I did in Intro to Engineering and Robotics was creating a robot. The robot was modified to do a series of certain tasks every week or two. I did this by modifying its parts and changing its code to suit the current task. A roadblock I faced was creating the code in this project. I learned how to use Orion Boards during this project.
